			"question": "Who can participate?",

			"question": "Where does the hackathon/workshops take place?",
			"answer": "Kickoff and Project Demos will be held in Davis Auditorium inside CEPSR. Technical workshops will be held in IAB. The main hackathon will be held inside Uris. Check the <a class='scroll' href='#schedule'>schedule</a> for up-to-date locations."
		},
		{
			"question": "Do I need experience?",
			"answer": "No! Because everyone might be starting from different experience backgrounds, DevFest contains two separate curriculums, depending on whether or not you are learning to program for the first time, or looking to build your first app.  Plus, there will be plenty of people there to help during the week.  Take a look at the <a class='scroll' href='#curriculum'>curriculum</a> to get started."
		},
		{
			"question": "Do I have to come to the entire week?",
			"answer": "Only if you want to! Choose the <a class='scroll' href='#schedule'>workshops</a> you’d like to attend. We recommend you to go to all the events, though, if you really want to learn how to build a web app."
		},
		{
			"question": "Will there be food?",
			"answer": "YES! There will be dinner served every night during the workshops and food throughout the week! If you have any food allergies make sure to state them when you <a class='scroll' href='#register'>register</a>, or just <a href='mailto:devfest@adicu.com'>email us</a>."
		},
		{
			"question": "Do I need a team or idea to sign up?",
			"answer": "Nope. Just come with a willingness to learn something new!"
		},
		{
			"question": "When can I start working on my app?",
			"answer": "You can start working on your app as soon as the kickoff begins!  Then, you can work on your app throughout the week."
		},
		{
			"question": "What if I just want time to develop or get help?",
			"answer": "During our “Open Hack Spaces”, we encourage you to practice what you learned during one of the technical workshops or work on your DevFest project!"
		},
		{
			"question": "Where do I sign up?",
			"answer": "Register <a href='#register' class='scroll'>here</a>!"
